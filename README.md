# Slither-Script

Slither-Script is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to control a snake, eat food, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging as you progress.
